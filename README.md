Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Calum
======================

I'm a software engineer, and I love building cool things in open source. My current interests lie at the intersection of AI and distributed systems, specifically how can we build systems to support AI, and how can we integrate AI into existing systems. I like to seek out the most interesting and challenging problems which I think will have a large impact, and build creative solutions to them. I also like to share my passion for open source with others, and I work to enable and encourage new contributors. Recently I led the push to restart the UX working group in Knative so that we could figure out how designers can more actively participate in open source.

I'm currently a Knative Eventing maintainer and lead the UX Working Group. In the past I have also been a LFX mentor, where I mentored three projects related to Knative.

I share my thoughts and ideas about software and open source [on my blog](https://www.calummurray.dev/blog).

If you want to collaborate on a project, are looking for help on your open source journey, or want to chat about tech feel free to reach out!
